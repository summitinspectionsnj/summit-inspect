 * What an intake source file can be.
 *
 * Three values, not two. `bin` exists because every real vendor export we have
 * measured is binary: a Spectora template export is XLSX, a Home Inspector Pro
 * template is a zip, and a HomeGauge form links a PDF. Storing those as text
 * does not merely fail to parse them — it destroys them, because a UTF-8 decode
 * of arbitrary bytes is not reversible.

/**
 * Names stored as raw vendor-export bytes rather than flattened CSV. Lower-cased before matching.
 *
 * Most entries are binary containers; .ht4 is XML text but is still a vendor\n * template export and must use the vendor-export size cap rather than the CSV cap.\n * The test this list applies is NOT "can something here parse it". It is
 * narrower and it is the only one a name can answer: would decoding these bytes
 * as UTF-8 destroy them. A format nothing here reads still belongs on the list —
 * it is kept whole, filed as `bin`, and routed to the assisted path with its
 * bytes intact, which is the outcome the operator can still act on.
 *
 * A workbook has several dialects and they are all the same decision: `.xlsm`
 * and `.xlsb` are what Excel writes for a macro-enabled and a binary workbook,
 * `.ods` and `.numbers` are the two other office suites' packages. Every one of
 * them is a container. A name missing from here is not merely unrecognised — it
 * falls to `csv`, so the file is stored as `source.csv` stamped `text/csv` and
 * measured against the SMALLER cap, and the operator is told their spreadsheet
 * is too big for a file nowhere near the limit for its kind.
 *
 * `.xlsm` is on the list ON PURPOSE, macros and all. Nothing here executes a
 * workbook: the reader pulls one zip entry (`xl/worksheets/sheet1.xml`) and
 * parses XML, and `vbaProject.bin` is never opened. Refusing by name would also
 * refuse nothing real — the same bytes renamed `.xlsx` are accepted by every
 * check downstream, because those read the file's leading bytes rather than its
 * name — while turning away operators whose export merely carries the suffix.
 * Where a person opens one of these by hand, the staff-download route is the
 * boundary that governs it, and it already serves the bytes as
 * `application/octet-stream` under a name with no extension at all.
