/**
 * Which products an entry point accepts an export from.
 *
 * This list replaced a rule that was deleted: the intent used to DECIDE the
 * vendor — `templates.create` meant Spectora, always — so the product could
 * read exactly one vendor's templates and had no way to say so. The operator
 * now declares the source, and this module is the only place that says which
 * declarations an entry point will take.
 *
 * The assertions that matter here COMPARE. "Spectora is offered" is true of a
 * list that offers everything to everybody, so each case is paired with an
 * entry point that must NOT carry the same option, and `readHere` is checked
 * against the adapter registry rather than against itself — a hand-written
 * flag that nothing cross-checks is how a vendor comes to be advertised as
 * readable months after its reader was removed.
