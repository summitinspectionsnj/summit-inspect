 * template was answered with "nothing could read that", which is true and
 * useless. With a declaration in hand the question changes from "can I read
 * this" to "is this what you said it was", and that has a specific answer.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no message catalogue, no server import that pulls a reader
 * into the browser bundle. The sentences are the picker's, keyed by vendor;
 * what lives here is only which options an entry point offers and whether each
 * one is read on this deployment or by a person.
 *
 * ⚠️ `readHere` is a claim about the ADAPTER REGISTRY, restated here rather
 * than imported from it — importing `adapters/registry` would drag a zip
 * reader, an XLSX reader and a Java-serialisation reader into every page that
 * renders an upload form. `import-sources.test.ts` asserts the two agree, in
 * both directions, so the restatement cannot drift into an advertisement for a
 * reader that no longer exists.
