/**
 * Which product this export came from.
 *
 * ── Why this screen exists ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The intent used to decide the vendor, so `templates.create` meant Spectora
 * and a Home Inspector Pro file was answered with "nothing could read that".
 * The declaration turns that into "this is not what you said it was", which is
 * a sentence the operator can act on.
 *
 * ── The two things every row has to say ─────────────────────────────────────
 * WHICH FILE, AND WHERE IT LIVES. Not knowing that is the earliest and
 * quietest failure in the whole flow: the wrong file is exported, uploaded,
 * and refused, and nothing on the way told anybody what to export instead.
 *
 * WHAT HAPPENS NEXT, INCLUDING WHEN IT IS SLOW. A product with no reader here
 * goes to a person, and that path is measured in working days. Saying so on
 * the picker beats saying it after the file has been handed over — and the
 * sentence changes again where the deployment has nobody to hand it to, which
 * is a refusal rather than a wait.
 *
 * The "how long" copy for a product WITH a reader used to state no number,
 * because nobody had measured a real conversion in workerd and an invented
 * duration is worse than none. It has now been measured (2026-08-25), against
 * real vendor exports, in real workerd rather than Node:
 *
 *   · a 1873-row by 42-column spreadsheet export -> 43 ms median
 *   · a 357-item template archive                ->  9 ms median
 *
 * Both are medians of seven runs; the numbers, the file hashes they were taken
 * against, the method and a measured linear scaling curve live in
 * `tests/fixtures/intake/manifest.json` under `measurements` and `scaling`.
 * Node was measured on the same bytes and over-reported by 1.5x and 2.6x —
 * so the familiar "Node is about 2.5x" is workload-dependent, not a factor you
 * can divide by.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY THE COPY SAYS A SCALE AND NOT THE NUMBER. 43 ms is our end of it. What
 * the operator actually waits through is their own upload of a file that runs to
 * hundreds of kilobytes, which we neither measure nor control, so a figure would
 * be precise about the wrong quantity. "Seconds, not minutes" is true of the
 * whole wait and answers the question §3.2b is really asking — which is whether
 * this is the kind of wait you sit through.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND WHY IT STILL SAYS TO STAY. §3.2b attaches "you can leave this page" to
 * a path taking more than a few seconds. This one does not, and the invitation
 * would be actively wrong here: the file is read INSIDE the upload request, so
 * leaving loses the import. The absence is asserted, not just omitted.
 *
 * ── Native form field ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The radios carry `name="vendor"`, so the declaration reaches the server
 * through the browser's own multipart encoding rather than through a second
 * piece of state that could disagree with what is on screen.

                               instead" while the panel underneath asked for a
                               printed PDF, and both were visible in one
                               screenshot. Every unit test in this directory
