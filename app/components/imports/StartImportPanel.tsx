/**
 * The form that turns a file into an import run.
 *
 * A NATIVE form submission, not a fetcher. The file has to reach the server as
 * multipart, and the guarded submit this app uses everywhere else carries a
 * `Record<string, string>` — a `File` spread into one becomes nothing at all,
 * silently, which is how a working-looking upload sends an empty body. The
 * browser's own encoding is the thing that already knows how to do this, so
 * the input stays a real form control and the run's id comes back as a
 * redirect rather than as data this component has to act on.
 *
 * Which is also why the input is `sr-only` rather than `hidden`: it still has
 * to hold the chosen file when the form submits, and it still has to be
 * focusable. Only its APPEARANCE is replaced, by the label beside it.
 *
 * ── The workbook, and the three things not to undo ──────────────────────────
 * An `.xlsx` chosen here is parsed IN THE BROWSER and replaced, in this same
 * input, by one sheet of it as CSV. That is why the form stays a native
 * submission and why nothing downstream changes: the server, the mapping step
 * and the preview step receive a CSV they already know how to read.
 *
 * 1. The parsed workbook lives in a REF, not in state and not in the input.
 *    After the first swap the input holds the CSV, so the workbook is gone from
 *    it — changing the sheet has to re-convert from the ref, or it would be
 *    converting a CSV.
 * 2. Conversion is keyed on the DECLARED VENDOR, not on the file extension. A
 *    Spectora export is also an `.xlsx`, and the server opens it as a package
 *    itself; flattening one sheet of it would destroy it. `sourceIsTabular`
 *    answers this, and the entries where it is true have exactly one source, so
 *    the vendor cannot change after a file is chosen.
 * 3. A workbook nothing here can read is left ALONE, and the submit stays
 *    enabled. That file then travels exactly as it does today. Blocking it
 *    would remove that path from the product without changing a line of server
 *    code.
 *
 * The two agreements are separate controls because they authorise different
 * things with different lifetimes. Keeping the file is about resuming this
 * run; letting a person open it is about a third party's contact details being
 * read by our staff. One checkbox covering both would either over-ask
 * everybody or under-ask the case that matters.
